This project hosts several of my home-brew Java software projects.

I just code for fun, so expect a wide variety of small apps. Some may be of use/interest to a broader audience, like the SudokuSolver or FlickrStore (which is great, but a pain to maintain). Some of the apps were written for a specific goal and thus are interesting and functional, but often tailored to a very specific use-case (LogMonitor, PacketDistributor, ZF Prijslijst Beheer). The remainder of the apps are just-for-fun mini-apps which are just nice things for me to experiment with new patterns, frameworks or programming techniques in general.

Most of these projects are works-in-progress. So don't expect them to work out of the box. They are typically meant to be built using Eclipse 3.x
